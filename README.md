# [Create a React App in Your Local Environment](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)

It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. You’ll need to have `Node >= 10.16 and npm >= 5.6` on your machine. To create a project, run:

```js
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

# Keeper App Project - Part 1 Challenge

:hourglass_flowing_sand: :jigsaw: :question:

1. Create a new React app.
2. Create a App.jsx component.
3. Create a Header.jsx component that renders a `<header>` element to show the Keeper App name in an `<h1>`.
4. Create a Footer.jsx component that renders a `<footer>` element to show a copyright message in a `<p>` with a dynamically updated year.
5. Create a Note.jsx component to show a `<div>` element with a `<h1>` for a title and a `<p>` for the content.
6. Make sure that the final website is styled like the example shown [here](https://l1pp6.csb.app/)
**HINT: You will need to study the classes in the `styles.css` file to appy styling.**

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# [Create a React App in Your Local Environment](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)

It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. You’ll need to have `Node >= 10.16 and npm >= 5.6` on your machine. To create a project, run:

```js
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

Then open up the project folder and delete everything that is not needed, only leave: `public/index.html`, `src/index.js`, `node_modules`, `.gitignore`, `package-lock.json`, `package.json`, and `README.md`.

# Keeper App Project - Part 1 Challenge

:hourglass_flowing_sand: :jigsaw: :question: Below are the steps for **part 1 challenge**:

1.  Create a new React app.
2.  Create a App.jsx component.
3.  Create a Header.jsx component that renders a `<header>` element to show the Keeper App name in an `<h1>`.
4.  Create a Footer.jsx component that renders a `<footer>` element to show a copyright message in a `<p>` with a dynamically updated year.
5.  Create a Note.jsx component to show a `<div>` element with a `<h1>` for a title and a `<p>` for the content.
6.  Make sure that the final website is styled like the example shown [here](https://l1pp6.csb.app/)
    **HINT: You will need to study the classes in the `styles.css` file to apply styling.**

# Keeper App Project - Part 2 Challenge

:hourglass_flowing_sand: :jigsaw: :question: Below are the steps for **part 2 challenge**:

1.  Render all the notes inside `notes.js` as a separate `Note component`.

Now we have the **notes.js** files containing all the notes we need to render:

```js
const notes = [
  {
    key: 1,
    title: "Delegation",
    content:
      "Q. How many programmers does it take to change a light bulb? A. None – It’s a hardware problem"
  },
  {
    key: 2,
    title: "Loops",
    content:
      "How to keep a programmer in the shower forever. Show him the shampoo bottle instructions: Lather. Rinse. Repeat."
  },
  {
    key: 3,
    title: "Arrays",
    content:
      "Q. Why did the programmer quit his job? A. Because he didn't get arrays."
  },
  {
    key: 4,
    title: "Hardware vs. Software",
    content:
      "What's the difference between hardware and software? You can hit your hardware with a hammer, but you can only curse at your software."

# Keeper App Project - Part 3 Challenge

:hourglass_flowing_sand: :jigsaw: :question: Below are the steps for **part 3 challenge**:

### CHALLENGE:

1.  Implement the add note functionality.
    Create a constant that keeps track of the title and content.
    Pass the new note back to the App.
    Add new note to an array.
    Take array and render seperate Note components for each item.

2.  Implement the delete note functionality.
    Callback from the Note component to trigger a delete function.
    Use the filter function to filter out the item that needs deletion.
    Pass a id over to the Note component, pass it back to the App when deleting.

[This is the end result you're aiming for.](https://pogqj.csb.app/)

**index.js**

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./components/App";

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

**CreateArea.jsx**

```js
import React from "react";

function CreateArea() {
  return (
    <div>
      <form>
        <input name="title" placeholder="Title" />
        <textarea name="content" placeholder="Take a note..." rows="3" />
        <button>Add</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}

export default CreateArea;
```

**App.jsx**

```js
import React from "react";
import Header from "./Header";
import Footer from "./Footer";
import Note from "./Note";
import CreateArea from "./CreateArea";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <CreateArea />
      <Note key={1} title="Note title" content="Note content" />
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Keeper App Project - Part 3 Challenge Final Code

### Challenge Steps Code

#### Challenge Part 1 - Create a constant that keeps track of the title and content.

**CreateArea.jsx**

```js
import React, {useState} from "react";

function CreateArea() {

    /*
    1. Implement the add note functionality.
        - Create a constant that keeps track of the title and content.

     Save what's typed into the input under title and content
     */

    //Create the state for the constants - create an object that contains title and content
    const [note, setNote] = useState({
       //The initial state will be an object with a title and content key set to an empty string each
        title: "",
        content: ""
    });

    /*
    Receive an event when it gets triggered, and we'll destructure the event so
    that we get hold of the event.target name and value so we create
    a new destructured object using the const keyword and this destructured object
    will tap into the event.target.name and event.target.value
     */
    function handleChange(event){
        const {name, value} = event.target;
        /*
        Now name and value can be used as separate constants and we can
        add to the note by calling setNote. setNote will receive the previous note
        and we will use that to add to the existing note, so we return a new object
        with the previous note (prevNote) and in addition we will add the new
        name and value
         */
        setNote(prevNote => {
            return {
                ...prevNote,
                [name]: value
            };
        });
    }

  return (
    <div>
      <form>
        <input
            /*
            onChange - Now that we got the inputs controlled, the next step is to update them when they get changed
            inside the onChange call a function (handleChange), and then we can pass it in as the onChange
            */
            name="title"
            onChange={handleChange}
            value={note.title}
            placeholder="Title" />
        <textarea
            name="content"
            onChange={handleChange}
            value={note.content}
            placeholder="Take a note..."
            rows="5" />
        <button>Add</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}

export default CreateArea;
```

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\\
Open <http://localhost:3000> to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
